# Parallel or Concurrent

Concurrency is "at the same time", but there are some rules.<br>
In a way, they are board games or card games. <br>
This means people take their turn, and tell when it's someone else's turn.<br>
In other words: it is directed, there are rules.

Parallel is threading, they're a bit like First-Person Shooters.<br>
It's everyone's turn, all the time, anything can happen!.
